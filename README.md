Supplementary material for the paper ["Studying the link between radio galaxies and AGN fuelling with relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of flickering jets"](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.523.2478W/abstract), Henry W Whitehead, James H Matthews, 2023, MNRAS, DOI: 10.1093/mnras/stad1582. 

This repository includes all the supplementary material that will be published along with the paper. Movies are referenced in the main paper text and are included in the Movies/ subfolder here. The source code and PDF for the supplementary figures and captions are contained in the PDF/ subfolder.

Additionally, we have included movies of the density (rho.mp4), pressure (prs.mp4) and jet tracer (tr1.mp4). 

Movies can also be found on a YouTube playlist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlu3G_AtelcRNMBoQXU7kwRmYgcE32Nwf
